It works by dissolving ear waxand provides irrigation to flush it from the ear canal. By using CleanEars, ear wax is gradually removed from the ear within several hours or days. CleanEars is a safer alternative to using cotton ear buds. With CleanEars, you do not have to tilt your head or lie down for application, simply spray and go! Excess ear wax or ear impaction is often experienced in patients over 65 years of age especially those with hearing aids, however it can be a common problem in younger patients and children. Effects of accumulated ear wax in the ear canal can include hearing loss, pain, itching, tinnitus, vertigo, painful inflammation of the ear and chronic cough. CleanEars is a simple easy spray that removes ear wax using the following main ingredients:• Squalene: a similar composition to ear wax but in liquid form. When it is sprayed into the ear, the squalene collides with the cerumen and through imparting its kinetic energy, it partially liquifies the ear wax.• Mineral oil: helps irrigate the ear and removes the dissolved ear wax from the ear canal.• Spearmint oil: warms the ear canal and provides a pleasant odour. To use CleanEars simply apply 1-2 sprays in each ear 3 times per day until the wax dissolves. There\'s no need for you to lie down for application, just spray and go!', image: 'https://www.pharmacyonline.com.au/media/catalog/product/cache/3e6a76ef90c487c9b0a5c089cb1584af/3/2/329118.jpg', price: 13.50, rating: 4.5, quantity: 10},

Factors like age, diet and environment can deplete your bodies collagen levels leading to the degeneration of collagen rich areas of the body like your skin. This degradation can cause changes in the body associated with aging, like wrinkles and aching joints.  Supplementing with collagen can help slow this depletion and minimise the negative effects associated. As a protein collagen is a source of amino acids like glycine, proline and lysine which have integral roles in the body building connective tissue and regulating cell growth. This benefits skin, muscle, hair, cartilage, ligaments and even blood cell growth. While the amino acid glutamine has also been associated with preventing inflammation of the gut wall and contributing to overall gut health. The word \'Hydrolysed\' refers to a process where the long chain triple helix protein that forms collagen is broken down into shorter pieces. This results in short individual chains of amino acids called peptides which are easier for the body to digest and utilise the amino acids.
